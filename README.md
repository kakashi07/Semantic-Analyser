# Semantic-Analyser
This project was developed as a part of course work for Artificial Intelligence course offered by Colombia University on Edx.

The project uses reviews from users on IMDB to effectively train and test a NLP model that can distinguish whether a user feedback is positive or negative. It effectively uses Unigram and Bigram Models to calculate the predictions.
Using Tfidf vectorizer to supress common yet useless words helped improve the accuracy.
